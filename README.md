# Proot Dev Mods — Ubuntu & Development on Android via Termux

Run a full **XFCE desktop** with **VSCode**, **Chromium/Firefox**, **Chrome if on compatible chipset**, development tools, media editors, network utilities, **Wine**, and **cloud storage** (Google Drive & Dropbox) on Android — no root required.


![proot-dev-mods](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84dfd64c-6c12-4857-b03f-79859d68243a)
Runs on majority of Android hardware - including this tiny phone!


Uses `proot-distro` to install Ubuntu, then applies sandbox/GPU/keyring mods that Electron, Chromium, and Wine need to function inside proot.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install F-Droid and Termux

**First, install F-Droid** (open-source app store):
1. Go to **https://f-droid.org** on your Android browser
2. Download and install the F-Droid APK
3. Android may warn about "unknown sources" — allow it (this is expected for apps outside the Play Store)
4. You may need to disable **Google Play Protect** temporarily if it blocks the install

**Then install Termux from F-Droid** — **NOT** the Play Store version (it's outdated and will not work). The Termux developer officially recommends the F-Droid build.

Also install **Termux:API** from F-Droid and a VNC viewer — **RealVNC Viewer** (Play Store) is recommended.

> **Android 12+ users**: You must disable the Phantom Process Killer or Termux will be killed randomly. See [instructions.md](instructions.md) Section 3 for the full fix.

### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install git -y
git clone https://github.com/user/proot-dev-mods.git
```

### 3. Run the Termux setup

```bash
cd proot-dev-mods
chmod +x setup-termux.sh
bash setup-termux.sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions — the script will:
- Install `proot-distro`, TigerVNC, PulseAudio, Termux:X11 support
- Download and install Ubuntu (you choose the version)
- Copy scripts into the proot environment
- Let you configure resolution presets for your device(s)
- Create launcher scripts in your Termux home (`~/`)

### 4. Set up the desktop inside Ubuntu

```bash
proot-distro login ubuntu-oldlts    # (or your chosen alias)
bash /root/setup-proot.sh           # Installs ~30 apps + desktop customization
```

Follow the prompts — you'll choose browsers, hostname, and whether to enable SSH.

### 5. Exit proot and start the desktop

```bash
exit
cd ..                               # (back to Termux home)
bash ~/start-ubuntu-vnc.sh          # Starts VNC in the background
```

Open **RealVNC Viewer** → New Connection → `localhost:5901` or `127.0.0.1:5901`  (You can also connect from a remote PC by replacing `localhost` with your device's IP address)

The VNC server runs **in the background** — your Termux shell stays usable. Use `bash ~/stop-ubuntu.sh` when you're done.

### 6. (Optional) Set up cloud storage

```bash
proot-distro login ubuntu-oldlts
bash /root/gdrive-mount.sh          # Google Drive via WebDAV
bash /root/dropbox-mount.sh         # Dropbox via WebDAV
```

After setup, browse Google Drive in Thunar at `dav://localhost:8880/` and Dropbox at `dav://localhost:8881/` — or use the `gdrive` / `dbx` CLI commands.

---

## Cloud Storage (Google Drive & Dropbox)

FUSE mounting (`rclone mount`) is **not available** inside proot (no kernel module). Instead, these scripts use rclone's built-in **WebDAV server** to expose cloud storage as a browsable network location. Files are accessed on-demand — nothing is synced or stored locally.

### Google Drive (`gdrive-mount.sh`)

| Port | Thunar Address | CLI Command |
|---|---|---|
| 8880 | `dav://localhost:8880/` | `gdrive` |

### Dropbox (`dropbox-mount.sh`)

| Port | Thunar Address | CLI Command |
|---|---|---|
| 8881 | `dav://localhost:8881/` | `dbx` |

### CLI Quick Reference

Both `gdrive` and `dbx` share the same subcommands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `gdrive ls [path]` | List files/folders |
| `gdrive tree [path]` | Tree view |
| `gdrive get <remote> [local]` | Download file or folder |
| `gdrive put <local> <remote>` | Upload file or folder |
| `gdrive mkdir <path>` | Create folder |
| `gdrive rm <path>` | Delete file/folder |
| `gdrive mv <from> <to>` | Move/rename |
| `gdrive cp <from> <to>` | Copy |
| `gdrive cat <file>` | Print file to stdout |
| `gdrive search <name>` | Search by name |
| `gdrive open [path]` | Open in Thunar via WebDAV |
| `gdrive start` | Start WebDAV server |
| `gdrive stop` | Stop WebDAV server |
| `gdrive status` | Show status & quota |
| `gdrive help` | Show all commands |

Replace `gdrive` with `dbx` for Dropbox — identical usage.

### OAuth Authentication

During setup, two methods are available:

- **Option A — Browser**: rclone opens the installed browser for sign-in (requires VNC desktop running)
- **Option B — Manual token**: rclone prints a URL; open it on any device, sign in, paste the token back

## Repair Scripts

### `chromium-repair.sh` — Browser Repair

Reinstalls Chromium v89 from Debian Buster and/or Firefox from Mozilla APT with all proot compatibility flags. Run if Chromium/Firefox break or won't launch.

```bash
bash /root/chromium-repair.sh    # Inside proot
```

### `vscode-repair.sh` — VSCode Repair

VSCode auto-updates regularly overwrite the proot wrapper (`/usr/bin/code`), `.desktop` files, and flags. This script restores everything in seconds.

```bash
bash /root/vscode-repair.sh      # Inside proot
```

---

## Backup & Restore

Run **in Termux** (not inside proot):

```bash
bash ~/proot-backup.sh backup           # Full backup → Internal Storage/proot-backups/
bash ~/proot-backup.sh backup --quick   # Skip caches/tmp (smaller, faster)
bash ~/proot-backup.sh restore <file>   # Restore from archive
bash ~/proot-backup.sh list             # List available backups
bash ~/proot-backup.sh info <file>      # Show backup metadata
```

Backups are saved to `Internal Storage/proot-backups/` — accessible from Android's file manager, USB, ADB, or rclone.

## Display Options

| Feature | VNC (Recommended) | Termux:X11 |
|---|---|---|
| **Start command** | `bash ~/start-ubuntu-vnc.sh` | `bash ~/start-ubuntu-x11.sh` |
| **Viewer** | RealVNC Viewer → `localhost:5901` | Termux:X11 app |
| **Setup effort** | Lower — just install RealVNC | Needs sideloaded APK |
| **Performance** | Good | Better (native Wayland) |
| **Audio** | PulseAudio TCP → Android speakers | Same |
| **Stop** | `bash ~/stop-ubuntu.sh` | `bash ~/stop-ubuntu.sh` |

---

## Sound & USB

### Sound

PulseAudio runs in Termux and streams audio to Android speakers over TCP. VNC does **not** carry audio — sound plays directly through the device (which works perfectly since you're on the same physical device).

```bash
paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga   # Test sound
pavucontrol                                              # Volume mixer
```

### USB

USB OTG devices are bind-mounted into proot by the launcher scripts. When you plug in a USB device, Android prompts you to grant access to Termux.

```bash
lsusb                # List USB devices (inside proot)
termux-usb -l        # List USB devices (in Termux)
```

> **Note**: Raw USB access works (libusb, serial). Kernel-level auto-mounting requires Android root.

## Known Limitations

| What | Why |
|---|---|
| No `systemd` | proot is not a real VM — use `service` commands instead |
| No `snap` packages | Snap requires systemd + kernel features |
| No `docker` | Needs kernel namespaces — use remote Docker |
| No FUSE mounts | No kernel FUSE module — use rclone WebDAV server instead |
| No GDM/LightDM | Display managers need PAM/logind/systemd |
| No GPU acceleration | Software rendering only (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`) |
| USB auto-mount | Raw libusb access works; kernel-level mount needs root |
| Harmless sandbox warnings | "Failed to move to new namespace" — expected, ignore |
